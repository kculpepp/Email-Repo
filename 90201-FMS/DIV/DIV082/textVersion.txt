The Affordable Care Act requires employers to provide you a 1095-C Form to document your enrollment in healthcare coverage. Foundation Medical Staffing is currently producing a Form 1095-C for anyone who was employed by Foundation Medical Staffing in 2015. 

Your 1095-C will be mailed to your home address. Although you do not need to provide your 1095-C Form with your 2015 tax filing, please save this form with your tax documents.
