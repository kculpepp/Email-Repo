<p style="color:#FFFFFF;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;margin:0 0 10px;">Open enrollment begins on June 6, 2016, and is your opportunity to elect your health insurance and other benefits for the upcoming year or to make changes to your current plan without a qualifying event. New or changed elections will take effect July 1, 2016, providing you’re on an active assignment. </p>

<p style="color:#FFFFFF;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;margin:0 0 10px;padding: 0 18px;">This year’s open enrollment is ACTIVE, meaning you are required to either enroll or decline benefits. Your current benefits will not automatically roll over from the previous year. <span style="font-weight: bold;">If you do not actively make your elections, your benefits will be waived.</span></p>

<p style="color:#FFFFFF;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;margin:0 0 10px;">Look for an email on June 6, 2016, outlining plan information, premiums, and enrollment instructions. </p>
