Enroll for 2016 Health Insurance 

************************************************
Open enrollment starts June 6 and ends June 17, 2016. This is your opportunity to enroll in benefits or make changes to your current benefits without a qualifying event. Elections you make will be effective July 1, 2016, providing you’re on an active assignment. 

As part of our dedication to Continuous Improvement and Enhanced Customer Service, we are using a new enrollment system and this year’s Enrollment is active. This means you are required to elect or waive benefits and the prior year’s elections will not carry over. Whether you are enrolling or declining coverage you will need to access the online enrollment system to make your elections, which go into effect July 1, 2016.

Please note the following changes for the 2016-2017 plan year: 

   •  Addition of Chiropractic Care benefit – 20 visits per calendar year
   •  AmeriBen Mobile App – 24/7 access to your ID cards
