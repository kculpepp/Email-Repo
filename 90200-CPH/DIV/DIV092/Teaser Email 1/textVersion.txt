Dear %%First_Name%%,

As we push toward implementing an electronic time entry and approval process, our first step is instituting a weekly time capture and approval process.

You should anticipate this new process starting the week of July 11.

This change improves how we collect and approve work records. It is our hope that you will find a reduction in timekeeping errors and an overall increase in invoice accuracy.

Please note that while you will be approving work records weekly, youâ€™ll still receive invoices biweekly. Each biweekly invoice will continue to include two weeks of time worked.

If you have any questions, please contact our payroll team at 877.222.2809.

I am also happy to help answer any concerns you might have.
