Dear %%First Name%%,

We’re happy to let you know that weekly pay is here. This change is the first step in moving toward an electronic time entry and approval process.

Beginning this week, you will start tracking hours worked and submitting work records weekly. Your first weekly pay check will then be distributed July 22. 

Your submission time and day to receive weekly pay is Monday at 3pm eastern.

Remember to keep submitting work records weekly to ensure prompt payment. And if you want to get paid even faster, sign up for direct deposit if you haven’t already.

Please note: Benefits deductions will be taken out every week and the weekly deduction will be half of the biweekly deduction. Refer to the benefits brochures effective July 1, 2016 for details.

We’re excited to be offering this to you as a benefit. If you have any questions, please contact our payroll team at 800.634.9581.

I am also happy to help answer any concerns you might have.
