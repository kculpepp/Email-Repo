Hello,

In the process of creating your most recent paycheck, our system failed to produce the electronic view (a PDF) of your pay stub. Unfortunately, we do not have a way to recreate the PDF and email it to you, but rest assured, your pay was appropriately deposited into your bank account. 

Weâ€™ve since remedied the issue, so you can expect to receive an electronic copy of your pay stub for future direct deposits. 

Please accept our apology for any confusion or inconvenience. If you have any questions or would like year-to-date pay information, please contact our Payroll team at 877.222.4272 or chgpayroll@chghealthcare.com.
