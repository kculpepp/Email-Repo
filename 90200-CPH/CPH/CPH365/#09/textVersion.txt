Prepare now to get the salary you deserve.

************************************************
When it comes to compensation, every offer you don’t negotiate is salary and benefits you’re missing out on. We want you to get what you deserve. 

That’s why we help fellows like you learn to negotiate and get the best package available. Our recruiters will answer questions, provide coaching, and help you gain much-needed confidence.

We also have a full library of aids, articles, and materials on our Resources (http://www.comphealth.com/resources/for-job-seekers/?source=et-%%emailname_%%-%%jobid%%) page, including our “Contract Negotiation Checklist.” It’s completely free and ready to use. Check it out and then give us a call. We’re happy to help you with all aspects of your job search.
