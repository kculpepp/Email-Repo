<p style="color:#444444;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:0">Three professors from Towson University are developing an app that will assist stroke survivors' recovery efforts. The product is called Armstrokes.</p>

<p style="color:#444444;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:0">"It's a neat way for stroke survivors to improve their mobile ability," Towson occupational therapy professor Dr. Sonia Lawson said. "A lot of times after a stroke, people have problems with moving. They also have problems with thinking. Our app pretty much targets the moving part."</p>

<p style="color:#444444;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:0">The project is being supported by the Aetna Foundation and the School of Emerging Technologies at Towson University.
