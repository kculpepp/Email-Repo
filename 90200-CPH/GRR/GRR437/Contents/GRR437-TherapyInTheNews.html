<p style="color:#444444;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:0">Hearing loss affects 48 million people in the United States, and technological advances continue to provide new treatment options for those who seek it. One of these devices is a vest, which uses vibrating motors, that could allow deaf individuals to feel speech.</p>

<p style="color:#444444;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:0">“The thing to note is that this is exactly what your inner ear does,” said David Eagleman, a co-creator of the vest. “Your inner ear just breaks things up into frequencies and you’ve got from high to low and that’s how your brain receives the information.”</p>

<p style="color:#444444;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:0">While the vest is still in the development stage, it could eventually be an affordable alternative to current devices like cochlear implants.</p>
