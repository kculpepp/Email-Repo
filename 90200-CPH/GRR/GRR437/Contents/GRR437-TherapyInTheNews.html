<p style="color:#444444;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:0">An app called SpellBound is helping children practice their fine motor skills while they recover from injuries and illnesses. The app was created by Christina York and her startup company, ALTality. The company began about a year and a half before “Pokemon Go” became an international phenomenon. Now it works in conjunction with “Pokemon Go” and other augmented reality games.</p>

<p style="color:#444444;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:0">“AR has fascinated me, and I think there are a lot of problems which augmented reality can help solve,” York said.</p>

<p style="color:#444444;font-family:Arial;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:0">SpellBound has been a big success, so York is now focusing on new technology to help pediatric hospitals entertain and engage patients.
