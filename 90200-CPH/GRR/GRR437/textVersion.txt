Michaele D., OT

Currently on her first assignment, Michaele is enjoying her experience in Colorado. Though there were multiple staffing companies to choose from, Michaele decided to work with CompHealth because she felt our recruiters were honest and would support her in her travels.

Speaking of the partnership she has with CompHealth, Michaele says she felt like “a team member right from the start.”

Michaele plans to continue to travel because she wants to explore new areas of the country. She also wants to use it as a way to develop professionally. “I want to gain a better perspective of the areas of OT I would like to further pursue,” she says.

According to Michaele, one of the benefits of travel is meeting a variety of new people. When she’s not working, Michaele loves to go dancing. She also makes time for hiking, jewelry making and all kinds of outdoor activities.

What’s the secret to a fulfilling travel assignment? Based on her experiences so far, Michaele says you just need to be open to new adventures.

Santa Barbara, CA

Living between the Pacific Ocean and the picturesque Santa Ynez Mountains, Santa Barbara residents are used to being between a rock and a beach place.

Brain injury research validates new assessment tool.

New research has revealed four distinct patterns of symptoms that occur after traumatic brain injury in military service members. This is crucial because TBI is a major concern for the military, with more than 294,000 individuals affected between 2000 and 2013.

According to experts, the research also validates a new questionnaire that is used to assess an individual’s health-related quality of life after TBI. This tool evaluates 20 subscales in the areas of physical and emotional health, cognition and social participation.
