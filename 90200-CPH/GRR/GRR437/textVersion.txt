Spotlight
************************************************
Jackie C., OT

From experiencing Southern hospitality in the Carolinas to exploring a ghost town in California, travel assignments have helped Jackie see the nation like never before.

"Travel jobs are in line with my hobbies and interests," says Jackie. "As a permanent employee, I couldn't accrue PTO fast enough to go and see the places I wanted to. As a traveler, I'm basically on a perpetual vacation."

In addition to the fun side of things, each assignment has given Jackie exposure to different therapists who help her better herself professionally. She feels that the more she travels to different places, the more she'll be able to add skills to her repertoire.

During her time off, Jackie enjoys exploring national/state parks and historic sites. Learning about the regional culture and contributing to her community are among her chief priorities.

"I've found that it's really rewarding to get involved and find volunteer opportunities in the area," she says. "It's a great way to give back to where I'm visiting and meet like-minded people."

Therapy in the News

Recovering in reality with augmented reality games.

An app called SpellBound is helping children practice their fine motor skills while they recover from injuries and illnesses. The app was created by Christina York and her startup company, ALTality. The company began about a year and a half before “Pokemon Go” became an international phenomenon. Now it works in conjunction with “Pokemon Go” and other augmented reality games.

“AR has fascinated me, and I think there are a lot of problems which augmented reality can help solve,” York said.

SpellBound has been a big success, so York is now focusing on new technology to help pediatric hospitals entertain and engage patients.
