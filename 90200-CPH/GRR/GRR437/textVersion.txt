Anna B., OT

Anna started traveling in the spring of 2013. Her assignments have taken her from coast to coast, with stops in North Carolina, West Virginia, Illinois, New Mexico, and Washington.

“Travel to all parts of the country to take advantage of all it has to offer,” recommends Anna. “I would also advise other travelers to explore different settings!”

Anna’s favorite assignment so far is the one she’s currently on in Spanaway, Washington. The school-based job has allowed her to work with a diverse population, be part of an excellent interdisciplinary team, and increase her competency in the school setting. The location also gives her access to scenic beaches, mountains, and state parks.

One constant for Anna has been the support she’s received. She reports that she’s had amazing coworkers in every location. And the assistance of CompHealth has helped all of her experiences go well.

“CompHealth was able to offer me jobs in locations that I desired and helped me every step of the way, including licensing, relocation costs, rental cars, and accommodations that exceeded expectations,” says Anna. “CompHealth also offered unlimited online CEUs, competitive pay, and excellent communication with my recruiter.”

Because of these positive experiences, Anna plans to continue taking travel assignments and exploring new parts of the country.

Therapy in the News

Towson professors develop rehabilitation app for stroke survivors.

Three professors from Towson University are developing an app that will assist stroke survivors’ recovery efforts. The product is called Armstrokes.

"It's a neat way for stroke survivors to improve their mobile ability," Towson occupational therapy professor Dr. Sonia Lawson said. "A lot of times after a stroke, people have problems with moving. They also have problems with thinking. Our app pretty much targets the moving part."

The project is being supported by the Aetna Foundation and the School of Emerging Technologies at Towson University. You can get the full story by clicking here.
