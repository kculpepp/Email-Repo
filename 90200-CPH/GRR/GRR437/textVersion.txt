Spotlight

Nicole D., PT

As a 10-year-old, Nicole participated in a "Take Your Daughter to Work Day" with a family friend. The woman worked as an aide in an outpatient clinic, and after shadowing her, Nicole decided she wanted to be a physical therapist when she grew up.

In high school, Nicole took every opportunity to learn more about the profession. “I gravitated towards anatomy and biology in school,” she says. “And I continued to shadow therapists, enjoying all aspects of the profession and the dedication of therapists to help their patients.”

When Nicole shadowed a therapist who worked travel assignments, she discovered a new option for her future career. “I always enjoyed exploring and traveling, and this seemed to be the best of both worlds,” recalls Nicole.

Nicole has now worked assignments with CompHealth in Ohio, Indiana, Alaska, Washington, California, and Arizona.


“The majority of my time in Alaska was very memorable,” says Nicole. “I was able to see the northern lights, the Yukon Quest, and attempt dog-sledding and curling.”

Learning about the culture of each area is enjoyable for Nicole. She loves getting to know the locals and hearing their stories. And when she’s not meeting new people, you can often find her checking out a coffee shop, restaurant, winery, or bookstore.

Therapy in the News

Hearing loss affects 48 million people in the United States, and technological advances continue to provide new treatment options for those who seek it. One of these devices is a vest, which uses vibrating motors, that could allow deaf individuals to feel speech.

“The thing to note is that this is exactly what your inner ear does,” said David Eagleman, a co-creator of the vest. “Your inner ear just breaks things up into frequencies and you’ve got from high to low and that’s how your brain receives the information.”

While the vest is still in the development stage, it could eventually be an affordable alternative to current devices like cochlear implants.
