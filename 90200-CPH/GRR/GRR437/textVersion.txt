Jennifer T., PT

Jennifer has been traveling with CompHealth for four years now. It’s been an easy choice, according to her, because the CompHealth support team has always made her travel experiences easy.

“They take care of your licensing for you and are always there to answer any questions throughout your contract,” she says. “I also really appreciate the quality contracts they have.”

For an adventure-lover like Jennifer, travel assignments can be a match made in heaven. She’s hiked the mountains of Colorado, explored Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park, visited the Grand Canyon, and trekked along the coast of Maine, to name a few.

Jennifer’s assignment in Montrose, Colorado, has been her favorite so far. She did a mix of acute care and outpatient, and loved the staff she worked with. Because of the fun she had on the job, the days actually went by quickly. And whenever she had free time, she took full advantage of her surroundings. Highlights included a trip to the desert town of Moab, summiting numerous peaks, and skiing at Telluride.

Of course, it’s not only about the outdoor experiences. Jennifer has discovered there are also lots of opportunities for professional growth.

“Traveling enables me to learn many new skills from different PT disciplines as well as explore new areas and meet new people,” she says.

Kalamazoo shooting victim leaves rehab.

On February 20, a mass shooting in Kalamazoo left six people dead and two wounded. One of the injured was 14-year-old Abigail Kopf. She sustained a severe head injury and was initially presumed dead at the scene.

Through Abigail's determination and the support of an incredible staff at Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital, she is now able to walk, talk, and "almost run down the halls."

This is truly an inspirational account of how therapy can help transform lives in the wake of tragedy. You can get the full story by clicking here.
