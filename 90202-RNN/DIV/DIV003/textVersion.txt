2015 W-2 Tax Information from CHG Healthcare Services

************************************************
As you prepare to file your 2015 taxes, we’d like to give you some helpful information on the W-2 form you will be receiving for the time you traveled with us. You can access your W-2 right now through Ceridian Corporation’s secure website. (An actual W-2 statement will also be mailed to you on or before January 31, 2016.) Following are instructions on how to do this: 

Access Your W-2 Online Now

The online W-2 will have the words “Reissued Statement” on the form, which simply means that the “original” statement is the one you will receive in the mail. Both the printable online W-2 and the hard copy W-2 you receive in the mail are valid tax documents and can be submitted with your tax forms.

If you traveled with us last year and have previously registered with Ceridian, here is how you can access your W-2:
•	Go to: http://www.ces-ereports.com/cgi-bin/3pp.pl/eReports?cid=A06440 and enter the username and password you created last year. (If you have forgotten your username or password, please click on the “Forgot Login Information?” link and follow the instructions.)
•	Verify that the document type and tax year shown in the drop-down menus are correct; click on “Search” and then “View.”
•	Your W-2 should open up in a new browser window, and you can print or save it. 

If you haven’t done so previously, please take the following steps to register with Ceridian to view your W-2 online:
•	Go to: http://www.ces-ereports.com/cgi-bin/3pp.pl/eReports?cid=A06440 and click on the link that says: “If you would like to register based on your W-2, click here.”
•	Follow the registration prompts, noting that the CHG Healthcare Services “Company Access Code” is 123456. 

Please be advised: If you received health insurance through CHG Healthcare Services in 2015, you will receive a Form 1095-C from Benefits by the extended IRS deadline of March 31, 2016. This form is not required to be sent to the IRS with your 2015 federal income tax filing. If you have questions about this form, please contact the Benefits team at 800.811.1796.

Note: To access the Ceridian website from home, forward a copy of this email to a personal email account so you will have access to the links and instructions listed above.  
If you have any questions or concerns about your W-2, please feel free to contact the CHG Payroll team at chgpayroll@chghealthcare.com, or call us at 1.877.222.4272. 

Thank you.

*As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), also referred to as healthcare reform, CHG is required to display the entire value of your healthcare coverage on your 2015 W-2 form. This amount is the total employer contribution and employee premium for both medical and dental insurance for the 2015 plan year. It is located in Box 12 under code DD. PPACA does not mandate any taxation of this amount. The cost of your group health insurance is presented for informational purposes only and is intended to help you understand the true value of your healthcare coverage.
