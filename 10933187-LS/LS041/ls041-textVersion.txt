Take one spa treatment 
and we'll see you in the morning

************************************************
Looking for a little relaxation at FMX in Orlando? Youâ€™re invited to our spa event, where you can choose from five different spa treatments. Food and drinks will be served, so feel free to linger. Rather than a recruiting event, this is a chance to talk to other physicians about how they improve their work/life balance with locum 
tenens. No pressure, just answers.

Wednesday, September 21 
6:30-8:30pm 
Hyatt Regency Spa
