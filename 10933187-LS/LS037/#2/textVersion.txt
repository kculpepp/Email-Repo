Your medical experience can open the door to a new life experience

At some point, Dr. Norman Baron’s career took a turn. It didn’t feel like a job anymore. It felt like a piece of him. So when it came time to retire, Dr. Baron was faced with a choice. He could stop practicing medicine and lose something that he loved. Or he could continue delivering quality care while seeing new parts of the country by taking locum tenens assignments. The choice was easy. Now he’s putting his 40 years of experience to good use across the country and he couldn’t be happier.
