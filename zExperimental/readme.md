## Read Me ##
The intent of this folder is to put scratch and experimental code that pertains to a specific user then project.

Folder Structure should be tightly controlled
USER > PROJECT > Files

Files should be strictly named as follows to prevent confusion
USERINITIALS-PROJECT-NAME-DATE.EXT

Example:
- BMB-ZURB-INK-180815.html

Note:
Changes to a file should not require the creation of a new file -unless 30% or more of code is altered, in that case, the original file can be archived in a zold folder in the project folder. Ideally a zold transition would be a rare event -only needed when a complete rewrite has occurred, this will help development as files will have a larger chain of history states.
